# About

This project contains sources to give code examples how to use Chemaxon [JChem Base](https://chemaxon.com/products/jchem-engines) to search and store molecules.

Find sources in the `src` folder. If you want to compile and test, just run `gradlew build`. For this you have to set `chemaxonUser` and `chemaxonPassword` in `gradle.properties`.

You can find the original HTML files in `html` folder.
